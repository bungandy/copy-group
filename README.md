# Copy Group

A Python script that automatically copies files from an SD card and organizes them by creation date into date-based folders, featuring a beautiful animated progress bar.

## What it does

This script walks through all files on an SD card (or any mounted volume) and copies them to a local directory, automatically grouping them into folders named by their creation date (YYYYMMDD format). Features a sophisticated animated progress bar with gradient colors and real-time file transfer visualization.

## Features

- **Automatic date-based organization**: Files are grouped into folders named by their creation date
- **Beautiful animated progress bar**: Real-time gradient progress visualization with smooth animations
- **Duplicate detection**: Automatically skips files that already exist and are identical (size, modification time, and MD5 checksum)
- **Preserves file metadata**: Uses `shutil.copy2()` to maintain timestamps and other file attributes
- **Skips hidden files**: Automatically ignores files starting with '.' (like .DS_Store)
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles files that can't be read or copied
- **Safe operation**: Creates target directories as needed
- **Real-time progress**: Shows copying progress with animated indicators and file size information

## Configuration

Before running the script, edit the configuration variables at the top of `copy_group.py`:

```python
SDCARD_PATH = "/Volumes/Untitled/DCIM/"      # Update to your SD card path
TARGET_BASE = "/Users/andy/TRANSIT_BLACKBOX/_SANDISK_128/"       # Destination folder
```

### SDCARD_PATH
Set this to the mount path of your SD card or external drive. The script is configured to look in the DCIM folder by default.
- macOS: `/Volumes/[DriveName]/DCIM/`
- Linux: `/media/[username]/[DriveName]/DCIM/`
- Windows: `D:\DCIM\` or `E:\DCIM\` (if using Windows)

### TARGET_BASE
Set this to where you want the organized files to be copied. The script creates date-based subdirectories within this folder.

## Usage

1. **Mount your SD card** or external drive
2. **Update the configuration** in `copy_group.py`:
   - Set `SDCARD_PATH` to your drive's mount path (including DCIM folder if applicable)
   - Set `TARGET_BASE` to your desired destination directory
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python copy_group.py
   ```

## Progress Bar Features

The script features a sophisticated animated progress bar with:

- **Gradient color progression**: Smooth transitions from deep red to bright yellow
- **Animated leading edge**: Dynamic front edge that moves as files copy
- **Real-time file information**: Shows current file being copied with size and progress
- **Animated spinner**: Subtle spinning indicator showing activity
- **File type indicators**: Visual indicators for different file types (ðŸ“€ for general files)
- **Completion celebrations**: Special completion messages with success indicators

## Output Structure

The script creates a directory structure like this:

```
TARGET_BASE/
â”œâ”€â”€ 20231201/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_001.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_002.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VID_001.mp4
â”œâ”€â”€ 20231202/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_003.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DOC_001.pdf
â””â”€â”€ 20231203/
    â””â”€â”€ IMG_004.jpg
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules (no additional packages required):
  - `os`
  - `shutil`
  - `hashlib` (for MD5 duplicate detection)
  - `datetime`

## Notes

- The script uses file creation time (`st_birthtime` on macOS, `st_ctime` as fallback) for date grouping
- Hidden files (starting with '.') are automatically skipped
- The script will create the target directory if it doesn't exist
- Duplicate files are detected using file size, modification time, and MD5 checksum comparison
- The progress bar provides real-time feedback on copying speed and file sizes

## Troubleshooting

**"No such file or directory" error**: Make sure your SD card is properly mounted and the `SDCARD_PATH` is correct.

**Permission errors**: Ensure you have read access to the source files and write access to the target directory.

**Files not appearing**: Check that the files aren't hidden files (starting with '.') which are automatically skipped.

**Progress bar not displaying correctly**: Ensure your terminal supports ANSI color codes and Unicode characters for the best experience.
